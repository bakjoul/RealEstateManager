# Real Estate Manager

## About the app
Real Estate Manager is an Android app designed to assist real estate agents in managing the properties they list for sale. It enables agents to add, edit, and list properties, as well as display them on a map and filter them based on various criteria. Additionally, the app offers a loan simulator feature. The app is still under development.

What's taking me so long?\
Besides life's little surprises, i pride myself on pushing this project (way) further than what is asked, striving to adopt today's **good pratices** and become a **good developer**. Take a look at my code and feel free to give me your feedback!


>[!IMPORTANT]
>The app requires a valid Google API key (for Geocoding, Maps Static and Places APIs, and also Maps SDK), as well as a getgeoapi.com API key to have an up-to-date currency rate.
>[Getgeoapi.com](https://getgeoapi.com/) has a free plan that allows to have a currency rate updated every day.
